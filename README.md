Overview
ZeroLauncher
- This is the main GUI launcher for ZeroSlackr.
- ZeroLauncher is a custom build of podzilla2
  modified specifically for the purpose of launching
  other iPodLinux applications (such as podzilla2) as
  ZeroSlackr packs.
- It can also act as a normal podzilla2 build but
  requires modules to use a "PackInfo" file instead
  of "Module" and requires the module file to end with
  a file extension of ".zl" rather than ".mod.o".
For more information, see:
- http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Podzilla
- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface

Usage:
- The ZeroSlackr userland launches ZeroLauncher by default
  in an endless loop (or rather as long as
  "/opt/Base/ZeroLauncher/Launch/Launch.sh" exists)
  until the user chooses the "Power off" or "Reboot" option
  from the ZeroLauncher menu (or until iPodLinux freezes,
  in which the user should manually reboot by holding the
  correct key combinations for force rebooting their iPod
  (see http://ipodlinux.org/wiki/Key_Combinations).
- ZeroLauncher loads special podzilla2 modules from
  folders in "/opt" and "/opt/Base/ZeroLauncher/Add-ons".
- To add normal podzilla2 modules to ZeroLauncher, rename
  the "*.mod.o" file to "*.zl" and rename "Module" to
  "PackInfo" and place the module folder into
  "/opt/Base/ZeroLauncher/Add-ons"
  (it is recommended that normal modules be used by
  Podzilla2-SVN instead of ZeroLauncher as ZeroLauncher
  should be limited to only what is necessary for
  launching other apps).
- ZeroLauncher can also be FastLaunch'd through
  "Zillae > ZeroLauncher" but such is pretty pointless.
